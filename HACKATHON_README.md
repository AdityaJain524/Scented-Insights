## 📊 SECTION 1: 3-SLIDE PITCH CONTENT

### **SLIDE 1 – OBJECTIVE & PROBLEM STATEMENT**

#### Business Scope
**L'Oréal Luxe Division** – Scalable across global luxury fragrance portfolio (Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, Lancôme, Viktor&Rolf, Mugler)

#### The Problem
The luxury fragrance discovery landscape is dominated by hype, viral marketing, and influencer promotion rather than authentic expertise. First-time buyers and fragrance explorers face:
- **Information Overload**: Thousands of unverified reviews with no credibility filtering
- **Promotional Bias**: Difficulty distinguishing genuine opinions from sponsored content
- **Knowledge Barriers**: Intimidating fragrance vocabulary excludes beginners from meaningful participation
- **Impulse Purchasing**: Trend-driven buying leads to high return rates and dissatisfaction

#### Why This Matters
For L'Oréal Luxe, this creates missed opportunities for authentic brand education, sustainable customer relationships, and long-term loyalty. Consumers seek trust, not trends—yet current platforms reward virality over expertise.

#### Opportunity Gap
There is no platform that combines credibility-scored community insights with structured learning and AI-powered content analysis to elevate fragrance discovery from hype-driven impulse to informed, intentional choice.

## 🎬 SECTION 2: TEAM VIDEO SCRIPT (3-MINUTE PITCH)

### Distribution Strategy:
Each team member answers different questions based on their expertise and role, creating a cohesive narrative that flows naturally between speakers.

---

### **Question 1: JUDGMENT – What guided your decision-making in complex situations?**

**[Member 1 – 35 seconds]**

"Early in development, we faced a critical decision: should we prioritize viral engagement features or engineer for trust? Every fragrance platform out there chases likes and shares. We analyzed the problem differently—L'Oréal Luxe doesn't compete on trends; it competes on authenticity. We chose to build a credibility scoring system instead of a popularity algorithm. This meant rejecting conventional social media patterns and investing in AI bias detection and structured learning. It was complex, but our judgment was clear: trust engineering creates sustainable value, virality creates noise. That decision became the foundation of everything we built."

---

### **Question 2: RESILIENCE – What hurdles did you face and how did you overcome them?**

**[Member 2 – 40 seconds]**

"Our biggest challenge was the AI note extraction system. Training a model to understand subjective fragrance language—'woody,' 'powdery,' 'fresh'—while filtering out promotional buzzwords was incredibly difficult. Early versions had 40% accuracy. We were debugging for weeks. Instead of simplifying the feature, we pivoted: we built a hybrid system combining pre-trained NLP models with domain-specific training data scraped from expert reviews. We iterated over 15 versions, tested with real users, and refined continuously. Resilience for us wasn't just persistence—it was intelligent adaptation. We reached 85% extraction accuracy by combining technical rigor with user feedback loops. When real-time credibility scoring crashed our database, we didn't give up—we optimized queries, implemented caching, and restructured our data architecture until it worked at scale."

---

### **Question 3: AMBITION – What is the long-term vision of your project?**

**[Member 3 – 35 seconds]**

"Our ambition isn't just building a platform—it's reshaping how luxury fragrance is discovered and understood globally. We envision Scented Insights becoming the trusted knowledge infrastructure for L'Oréal Luxe: where every customer journey starts with learning, not advertising, and where AI-powered insights transform subjective art into accessible science. We see a future where fragrance literacy becomes universal, where sustainability is embedded in discovery, and where L'Oréal Luxe leads the industry by valuing expertise over influence. We're building white-label architecture for multi-brand scalability, developing multi-language AI models, and creating learning curricula that rival professional perfumery courses. This isn't a community platform—it's an education revolution disguised as one."

---

### **Question 4: EMPATHY – How do you support each other as a team?**

**[Member 1 – 35 seconds]**

"We built this project with empathy at the core—not just for users, but for each other. When one of us struggled with the credibility algorithm logic, we didn't just debug code—we whiteboarded the philosophy of trust together. When deadlines pressured us, we redistributed tasks based on individual strengths, not arbitrary splits. We created a team culture where asking for help is strength, not weakness. Every design decision was reviewed through the lens of 'who might this exclude?'—whether it's a beginner intimidated by fragrance jargon or a user with accessibility needs. Empathy shaped our product and our collaboration. We celebrated small wins, approached failures as learning opportunities, and ensured no one burned out. That psychological safety made us stronger as builders."

---

### **Question 5: LEARNING AGILITY – What unfamiliar areas did you encounter and how did you adapt?**

**[Member 2 – 35 seconds]**

"None of us were fragrance experts when we started—we were engineers and designers. We had to rapidly learn perfumery fundamentals: note pyramids, fragrance families, olfactory composition. We consumed expert content, interviewed perfumers, and studied luxury brand positioning. Simultaneously, we taught ourselves real-time database architecture, AI model fine-tuning, and trust-based algorithm design—areas beyond our academic experience. Our learning agility wasn't about mastering everything; it was about synthesizing cross-disciplinary knowledge fast. When I hit knowledge gaps in PostgreSQL optimization or NLP techniques, I didn't wait—I found experts, read source code, built test environments. We became domain-aware engineers, not just code executors. That agility turned unfamiliarity into our competitive advantage—we designed for users like us: curious, eager to learn, but needing structure."

## 🏆 SECTION 3: EVALUATION CRITERIA ALIGNMENT

### How Our Team Demonstrates "Strongly Observed (5 Points)" Across All Competencies

---

#### **1. JUDGMENT**

**Demonstrated Through Strategic Decision-Making:**

Our team consistently made high-stakes architectural decisions prioritizing long-term value over short-term wins. When designing the platform's core algorithm, we rejected conventional engagement-based ranking (likes, shares) in favor of credibility-weighted scoring—a riskier but strategically superior choice aligned with L'Oréal Luxe's brand values. 

We applied judgment in:
- **Technology Selection**: Choosing PostgreSQL + real-time architecture for scalability over simpler but limited solutions
- **Feature Prioritization**: Building AI bias detection before social features, recognizing trust engineering as foundational
- **Scope Management**: Focusing on three core innovations (credibility, AI extraction, learning paths) rather than surface-level feature sprawl

**Judgment Evidence**: Every major technical decision was evaluated through the lens of "Does this serve authentic fragrance discovery or just replicate existing noise?" This disciplined filtering process kept our vision sharp and execution focused.

---

#### **2. RESILIENCE**

**Demonstrated Through Problem-Solving Under Pressure:**

Our team encountered multiple technical and conceptual obstacles that required sustained resilience:

- **AI Model Challenges**: Initial note extraction accuracy was 40%; through 15 iterations, hybrid modeling, and user testing, we achieved 85% accuracy
- **Database Performance**: Real-time credibility score calculations caused latency issues; we implemented caching strategies and optimized query architecture
- **Learning Curve**: None of us had fragrance industry expertise; we rapidly self-educated through expert interviews, research, and immersive learning

**Resilience Evidence**: We didn't pivot away from difficult problems—we re-engineered solutions. When the AI model struggled, we didn't simplify the feature; we improved the training data. When credibility scoring proved computationally expensive, we optimized rather than removed it. Resilience for us was iterative excellence, not acceptance of limitations.
