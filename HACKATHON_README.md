## 📊 SECTION 1: 3-SLIDE PITCH CONTENT

### **SLIDE 1 – OBJECTIVE & PROBLEM STATEMENT**

#### Business Scope
**L'Oréal Luxe Division** – Scalable across global luxury fragrance portfolio (Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, Lancôme, Viktor&Rolf, Mugler)

#### The Problem
The luxury fragrance discovery landscape is dominated by hype, viral marketing, and influencer promotion rather than authentic expertise. First-time buyers and fragrance explorers face:
- **Information Overload**: Thousands of unverified reviews with no credibility filtering
- **Promotional Bias**: Difficulty distinguishing genuine opinions from sponsored content
- **Knowledge Barriers**: Intimidating fragrance vocabulary excludes beginners from meaningful participation
- **Impulse Purchasing**: Trend-driven buying leads to high return rates and dissatisfaction

#### Why This Matters
For L'Oréal Luxe, this creates missed opportunities for authentic brand education, sustainable customer relationships, and long-term loyalty. Consumers seek trust, not trends—yet current platforms reward virality over expertise.

#### Opportunity Gap
There is no platform that combines credibility-scored community insights with structured learning and AI-powered content analysis to elevate fragrance discovery from hype-driven impulse to informed, intentional choice.

## 🎬 SECTION 2: TEAM VIDEO SCRIPT

### Format: 
All three team members answer each question, providing different perspectives that together create a comprehensive response.

---

### **Question 1: JUDGMENT – What guided your decision-making in complex situations?**

**[Member 1 – 20 seconds]**

"From the start, we faced a critical choice: build for virality or engineer for trust. Every fragrance platform chases likes and shares. We chose differently. We analyzed L'Oréal Luxe's positioning—authenticity over trends—and built a credibility scoring system instead of a popularity algorithm. That judgment became our foundation: sustainable value requires trust engineering, not viral features."

**[Member 2 – 20 seconds]**

"My biggest judgment call was technology selection. We could've used simpler databases, but I pushed for PostgreSQL with real-time architecture because scalability mattered from day one. When teammates questioned the complexity, we evaluated it against L'Oréal's global scale requirements. The judgment was clear: build production-ready, not prototype-ready. That decision saved us from technical debt later."

**[Member 3 – 20 seconds]**

"I focused on feature prioritization. We had endless ideas—gamification, social features, AR try-ons. But judgment meant asking: what solves the core problem? We invested in AI bias detection before adding social features because trust had to come first. Every decision passed the test: does this serve authentic discovery or replicate existing noise? That discipline kept us focused."

---

### **Question 2: RESILIENCE – What hurdles did you face and how did you overcome them?**

**[Member 1 – 20 seconds]**

"Our AI note extraction model initially had 40% accuracy—unacceptable for production. We debugged for three weeks straight, testing different NLP approaches. Instead of giving up, we built a hybrid system combining pre-trained models with domain-specific fragrance vocabulary. Fifteen iterations later, we hit 85% accuracy. Resilience meant refusing to compromise on quality."

**[Member 2 – 20 seconds]**

"Real-time credibility scoring crashed our database under load testing. Calculations were too expensive. I spent days optimizing queries, implementing caching layers, and restructuring data models. When one approach failed, I tried another. The breakthrough came from denormalizing scores and using background jobs. Resilience wasn't just persistence—it was systematic problem-solving until we found the solution."

**[Member 3 – 20 seconds]**

"None of us knew fragrance terminology when we started. Learning note pyramids, olfactory families, and composition theory while building the platform was overwhelming. We interviewed perfumers, consumed expert content, and even visited fragrance stores. When our learning paths seemed too technical, user feedback told us to simplify. We iterated seven times. Resilience meant staying humble and adapting based on real-world testing."

---

### **Question 3: AMBITION – What is the long-term vision of your project?**

**[Member 1 – 20 seconds]**

"Our ambition is making Scented Insights the trusted knowledge infrastructure for L'Oréal Luxe globally. Imagine every YSL, Armani, and Lancôme customer starting their journey not with ads, but with education. We're building white-label architecture so each brand can have its own community portal while sharing cross-portfolio insights. This isn't just a platform—it's an ecosystem."

**[Member 2 – 20 seconds]**

"I envision AI-powered fragrance intelligence at scale. Our emotion extraction and bias detection models can process millions of reviews, identifying trends before they go mainstream. Long-term, we want to provide L'Oréal Luxe with predictive insights: what notes resonate with Gen Z? Which sustainability messages drive purchases? We're building the data infrastructure that turns community wisdom into business intelligence."

**[Member 3 – 20 seconds]**

"My ambition is democratizing fragrance literacy worldwide. We want to eliminate the intimidation factor—where beginners feel confident exploring luxury fragrances because they understand the language. Imagine fragrance education as accessible as cooking tutorials. We see learning modules translated into 20+ languages, partnerships with perfumery schools, and Scented Insights becoming the standard for how luxury brands educate consumers. This is an education revolution."

---

### **Question 4: EMPATHY – How do you support each other as a team?**

**[Member 1 – 20 seconds]**

"Empathy shaped our team culture. When someone struggled with complex algorithms, we didn't just debug—we whiteboarded the philosophy behind it together. When deadlines pressured us, we redistributed work based on individual strengths, not equal splits. We created psychological safety: asking for help is strength, not weakness. That empathy made us resilient as a team."

**[Member 2 – 20 seconds]**

"For me, empathy meant recognizing burnout before it happened. During intense development sprints, I noticed when teammates were overwhelmed and proactively suggested breaks or task switches. We celebrated small wins—not just big milestones. When someone's code didn't work, we approached it collaboratively, never critically. Empathy wasn't just support; it was creating an environment where everyone could do their best work."

**[Member 3 – 20 seconds]**

"Empathy extended beyond our team to our users. Every design decision passed the test: who might this exclude? When building learning paths, we assumed zero prior knowledge because we remembered feeling intimidated ourselves. When implementing credibility scoring, we ensured beginners could earn reputation through learning, not just expertise. Team empathy taught us product empathy—both made us better builders."

---

### **Question 5: LEARNING AGILITY – What unfamiliar areas did you encounter and how did you adapt?**

**[Member 1 – 20 seconds]**

"I had zero AI/ML experience before this project. I taught myself NLP fundamentals, studied bias detection algorithms, and learned to fine-tune language models through documentation and experimentation. The fragrance domain was equally foreign—I didn't know top notes from base notes. Learning agility meant parallel skill acquisition: technical depth and domain knowledge simultaneously. That cross-disciplinary synthesis became our competitive advantage."

**[Member 2 – 20 seconds]**

"Real-time database architecture was completely new to me. I learned Supabase, PostgreSQL optimization, and websocket infrastructure while building the platform. When I hit knowledge gaps, I didn't wait—I found experts, read source code, and built test environments. The fragrance industry positioning was also unfamiliar. I studied L'Oréal Luxe's brand architecture, competitive landscape, and luxury consumer psychology. Learning agility meant speed without compromising depth."

**[Member 3 – 20 seconds]**

"Trust algorithm engineering was uncharted territory. There's no textbook on credibility scoring for fragrance communities. I combined research from social networks, academic reputation systems, and Stack Overflow's scoring model, then adapted it to our context. Similarly, understanding luxury brand marketing required studying case studies and consumer behavior. Learning agility wasn't just acquiring information—it was synthesizing disparate knowledge into coherent innovation. We became domain-aware engineers, not just code executors."
